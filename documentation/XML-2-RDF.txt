XML 2 RDF converts the RDF file in to XML based on the given ontology.
The algorithm used in XML 2 RDF is as follows.

1- RDF file is seriallized in to XML/RDF file. 
  
This gives us the already built XML tags which automatically idetifies the root node and child element.

2- We remove the RDF seriallization from XML file .
    
The RDF seriallization is removed manually by reading the file line by line and preforming checks to 
delete the tags which start with RDF.

3- Once we have RDF free XML file , the next step is to identify Attribute Property. The Current XML
document is in ELement nodes form only. We need to identify its attribute properties which is impossible
to guess just by looking at RDF file.

e.g

our XML without attribute property.
<Attribute>
<length> 12.0 </length>
<Name> Max Speed </Name>
<Value> 2.0 </Value>
</>

should be :
<Attribute length= "12.0" Name= "Max speed" >
<Value> 2.0 </Value>
</> 


We used the approach to identify attribute properties by reading the orignal two XML files.
We parsed the orignal XML files and using DOM XML parser for java we got getAttributes() names .
Once we have the attribute names we can compare it with our RDF free XML document and mark the nodes
as Attributes.

Once we were able to mark the nodes which are Attribute properties , we used setAttribute() function
to include the attributes in our current XML document. We then remove the marked nodes from XML document
once they were added as Attribute.

4- We also made sure that our ontology followed rules for mapping property. We used has<property name>. 
Once our XML was created , we just had to filter out has String from our XML document which gave us the
orignal properties as defined in XML files.

Possible DrawBack of the current strategy:
